        </h1>
        <p>
          My aim for 2022 is to learn programming and become a MERN developer. I
          know the journey would not be smooth or easy for me but I am willing
          to provide my level best to utilize my full potential for this new aim
          that I developed recently. Won't stop before I reach the shore of
          coding.

          Web Development?
        </h1>
         <p>
          Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. <br>

          Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working. <br>

          Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified. <br>

          <br> The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.
